# Development Process

This document outlines the standard development workflow for the Void Champion Heroes project.

## Standard Development Workflow

1. **Task Assignment**
   - Retrieve task from Linear using the Linear MCP tool
   - Review task ID, description, and priority
   - Move task to "In Progress" status using the Linear MCP tool

2. **Task Analysis**
   - Review all references and documentation linked in the task
   - Identify related components and dependencies
   - Understand requirements and acceptance criteria

3. **Planning**
   - Develop implementation plan with clear steps
   - Identify potential challenges and solutions
   - Outline required changes to existing code

4. **Human Review (Planning)**
   - Present implementation plan to human collaborator
   - Discuss any questions or alternative approaches
   - Wait for explicit approval before proceeding

5. **Implementation**
   - Write code according to approved plan
   - Follow project coding standards and patterns
   - Document code with appropriate comments

6. **Human Review (Implementation)**
   - Present completed implementation to human collaborator
   - Demonstrate functionality and test results
   - Wait for explicit approval before proceeding


**Notes for overall collaboration**
- Always wait for explicit human approval at review checkpoints
- Maintain clear communication about implementation decisions
- Document any deviations from the original plan with rationale
- When in doubt, ask questions rather than making assumptions
